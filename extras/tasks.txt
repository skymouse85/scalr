make the domList a table that reads out all values (step, offset, octave, key signature (in a different div))
 (figure out how to do this dynamically in jquery)

add Ascending_Descending as octave option

generate beams in vexflow

Add common methods to base 

update MXML out put to include key signatures

think about how to diminished and other tonalities
