Add common methods to base 

make the domList a table that reads out all values (step, offset, octave, key signature (in a different div))
 (figure out how to do this dynamically in jquery)

update MXML out put to include key signatures

add Ascending_Descending as octave option

generate beams in vexflow


think about how to diminished and other tonalities
